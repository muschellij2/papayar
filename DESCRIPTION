Description: Users pass images and objects of class 'nifti' from the 'oro.nifti'
    package to a Papaya, an interactive lightweight JavaScript viewer.
    Although many packages can view individual slices or projections of
    image and matrix data, this package allows for quick and easy
    interactive browsing of images.  The viewer is based off of the
    Mango software, which is a lightweight medical image viewer.
